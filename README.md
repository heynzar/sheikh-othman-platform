## üéØ Goal

It all started the day I decided to learn more about Islam. I found many helpful resources,

but everything changed when I discovered Sheikh Othman Khames's series on YouTube. The content was exactly what I was looking for.

However, there were a bunch of playlists for the series, which led to distractions as I watched. Over time, I lost track of my progress, especially considering that some videos were quite long.

To solve this problem, I created this organized platform that combines all the videos from every playlist into one place.

It provides a distraction-free experience, along with a reliable progress tracking system, ensuring that users can continue learning easily without interruptions from unrelated content.
